# Pac-Boy

Similar to the well-known Pac-Man game, Pac-Boy is an action labyrinth pursuit game in which the user directs the titular figure through a confined maze. The aim of the game is to consume every dot scattered across the maze while dodging Pac-Man's pursuers, four ghosts. The player moves on to the next level when Pac-Man consumes all of the dots. Fruit symbols at the bottom of the screen represent levels.

Additional Features will include:
- Maze Variations
- Boss Battles
- Time Trials, and
- Power-Ups
to give the user a unique experience drifted away from the traditional Pac-Man game played all over the world!

Further updates will be posted here once the developers get started!
