# Pac-Boy

Theme: Sustainable Development Goal # 12

Similar to the well-known Pac-Man game, Pac-Boy is an action labyrinth pursuit game in which the user directs the titular figure through a confined maze. The aim of the game is to consume every dot scattered across the maze while dodging Pac-Man's pursuers, four ghosts. The player moves on to the next level when Pac-Man consumes all of the dots.

In line with the 12th Sustainable Development Goal, this game will be modified to promote proper segregation and recycling. The figure that is beng controlled by the user is tasked to bring the scattered "trash" around the maze to their designated recycling bins. An example is if there is a piece of plastic and a piece of paper, the user must know that these two items are supposed to be segregated separately and accordingly. To complete the level, the user must collect all the trash and put them in the proper bins. These pieces of trash will be the replacement of the big dots that were initially the power-ups of Pac-Man.

Additional Features will include:
- Maze Variations
- Time Trials, and
- Power-Ups

to give the user a unique experience drifted away from the traditional Pac-Man game played all over the world!
