# Pac-Boy

Theme: Sustainable Development Goal # 13

Similar to the well-known Pac-Man game, Pac-Boy is an action labyrinth pursuit game in which the user directs the titular figure through a confined maze. The aim of the game is to consume every dot scattered across the maze while dodging Pac-Man's pursuers, four ghosts. The player moves on to the next level when Pac-Man consumes all of the dots.

In line with the 13th Sustainable Development Goal, this game will be modified to promote proper cleaning and waste management. The figure that is being controlled by the user is tasked to collect the scattered "trash" around the maze to add points to their score. These pieces of trash will replace the big dots that were initially the power-ups of Pac-Man.

Additional Features will include:
- Different graphics display

to give the user a unique experience drifting away from the traditional Pac-Man game played all over the world!
